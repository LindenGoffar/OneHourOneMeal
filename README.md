# OneHourOneMeal
One hour of volunteer time == One meal for you or somebody in need = true;

This would be a volunteer incentive program with a very tangible outcome, One hour of volunteer time at an affiliated organization would make yourself or somebody in need eligible for one meal at an affiliated organization. 

# Goals
Provide those in need the opportunity to "earn" meals for themselves or family members through performing basic volunteer tasks, and have these volunteer hours tracked as a form of currency by organizations where the distribution of real currency or "jobs" is not a viable option. 

Provide those wanting to volunteer their time an incentive in the form of a trackable meal for one in need. Volunteers should be notified when their hour has provided a meal to an individual in need. 

A truly virtuous cycle is critical. Organizations participating in the program see an increase in the number of volunteer hours they benifit from and those volunteer activities accrue in some way to those organizations directly able to provide meals to those in need. 

# Assumptions
We can build a network of organizaions that center around the concept of providing food or other services to those in need, as the hours volunteered need to in some way benefit the organization providing the food. This helps ensure the virtuousness of the cycle. 

The tech is simple enough to use, and authenticate against, that even those in the most need in our community would have access sufficient to volunteer their time with one of these organizations and have this time validated and tracked to count toward a meal for themselves or a family member. 

The tech is accessible to those in the most need in our community, i.e. it could run on a very low end kiosk in a lobby, any cell phone, maybe even a bare bones SMS system? 

The tech is so simple that volunteer staff within any of the affiliated organzations would be willing and able to use it to verify volunteer hours (for a volunteer), confirm meals provided for an individual in need, any complexity is a show stopper for an already heavily taxed and often not very "technical" volunteer staff. Hours and Meals should be treated similar to currency a concept that most can easily understand.
